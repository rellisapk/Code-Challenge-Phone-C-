📱 Old Phone Pad - C# Code Challenge
This is a simple C# program that converts old mobile keypad input into text.

📝 How It Works
Each number represents letters like on an old phone keypad:
2 → ABC  
3 → DEF  
4 → GHI  
5 → JKL  
6 → MNO  
7 → PQRS  
8 → TUV  
9 → WXYZ 
Press the button multiple times to get different letters.
Example: 2 → A, 22 → B, 222 → C

Use a space (" ") to separate letters from the same button.
Example: "222 2 22" → "CAB"

* is a backspace (deletes the last letter).
Messages always end with # (send key), which is ignored).
